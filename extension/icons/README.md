# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows systems)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

The icons should represent the Portia AI brand and job tracking functionality:

- Use a consistent color scheme (blue/purple gradient)
- Include AI/robot symbolism (ðŸ¤–)
- Professional appearance suitable for job-related contexts
- High contrast for visibility in different themes

## Placeholder Icons

For development purposes, you can create simple placeholder icons:

1. Create a 128x128 canvas with blue background (#3b82f6)
2. Add white text "PA" (for Portia AI) in the center
3. Resize to create smaller versions (48x48, 32x32, 16x16)

## Production Icons

For production deployment, create professional icons that:

- Follow Chrome extension design guidelines
- Are optimized for different screen densities
- Maintain brand consistency
- Are recognizable at small sizes
