   // content-scripts/newplatform.js
   const PLATFORM_CONFIG = {
     selectors: {
       jobTitle: ['.job-title', 'h1'],
       company: ['.company-name'],
       // ... other selectors
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Update Manifest**:
   ```json
   {
     "content_scripts": [{
       "matches": ["https://newplatform.com/jobs/*"],
       "js": ["content-scripts/newplatform.js"]
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Add Background Support**:
   - Update URL patterns in background.js
   - Add platform-specific extraction logic

### Testing
- Test on actual job posting pages
